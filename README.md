# Welcome to Kidpass Challenge!

##To get started:
- npm install
- npm run start-dev
- to run tests: npm test

## Notes:
- This project uses Webpack for bundling and React for the front-end.
- Tests are written in Mocha and Chai
- Most of the code is commented but don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
- For the weight ordering, I relied on that the API call returned the responses in weight order and in other cases would provide checks to ensure they were sorted by weight in the component state arrays
